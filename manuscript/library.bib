abstract = {The acquisition of new motor skills is dependent on task practice. In the case of motor transfer, learning can be facilitated by prior practice of a similar skill. Although a multitude of studies have investigated the brain regions contributing to skill acquisition, the neural bases associated with the savings seen at transfer have yet to be determined. In the current study, we used functional MRI to examine how brain activation differs during acquisition and transfer of a visuomotor adaptation task. Two groups of participants adapted manual aiming movements to three different rotations of the feedback display in a sequential fashion, with a return to baseline display conditions between each rotation. Subjects showed a savings in the rate of adaptation when they had prior adaptive experiences (i.e., positive transfer of learning). This savings was associated with a reduction in activity of brain regions typically recruited early in the adaptation process, including the right inferior frontal gyrus, primary motor cortex, inferior temporal gyrus, and the cerebellum (medial HIII). Moreover, although these regions exhibit activation that is correlated across subjects with the rate of acquisition, the degree of savings at transfer was correlated with activity in the right cingulate gyrus, left superior parietal lobule, right inferior parietal lobule, left middle occipital gyrus, and bilaterally in the cerebellum (HV/VI). The cerebellar activation was in the regions surrounding the posterior superior fissure, which is thought to be the site of storage for acquired internal models. Thus we found that motor transfer is associated with brain activation that typically characterizes late learning and storage. Transfer seems to involve retrieval of a previously formed motor memory, allowing the learner to move more quickly through the early stage of learning.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to compare the accuracy, velocity, and kinematics of throws with the dominant and nondominant arms in experienced handball players. Significant differences in throwing accuracy and ball velocity were found: decreased maximal velocities of the major joint movements and especially decreased internal rotation velocity of the shoulder. Timing differences in the onset of some joint movements, which resulted in an altered throwing pattern, could explain differences in the throwing velocity. Lower ball velocity was compensated by the increased ball release height, which was caused by an increased shoulder abduction and trunk tilt sideways angle at ball release.},

abstract = {Differences between hands in motor performance are associated with differences in the interaction of inhibitory connections of homologous parts of the cerebral hemispheres. Modulation of these inhibitory connections in the right and left primary motor cortex (M1) may alter manual performance asymmetries. To investigate this assumption, eleven right-handed male university students performed a discrete aiming task in a digitizing tablet under three experimental conditions: dominant M1 inhibition, non-dominant M1 inhibition, and sham. The Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation technique was used to increase or decrease participants' M1 excitability. We used a within-subject design, in which we counterbalanced the order of conditions and the order of the starting hand among participants. The performance-dependent variables were: reaction time, movement time, and radial error, while kinematic variables were: peak velocity, relative time to peak velocity, and number of discontinuities in acceleration in the final homing phase. Results showed changes in asymmetry related to reaction time, movement time, and relative time to peak velocity. The interaction between M1 modulation and hemispheric specialization produced specific changes in these variables. Taken together, these findings revealed that modulation of the dominant and non-dominant M1 affects manual performance asymmetries.},

High index of difficulty and execution with the non-dominant hand can increase the mental workload.AIM: This study investigated the relation between the level of mental workload, the index of difficulty of the task, and handedness in manual movements.METHOD: Twenty-three right-handed male students (24.1 {\^{A}}± 4.3 years) participated in this study. The index of difficulty in the Grooved Pegboard task was manipulated by placing and removing the pegs and manipulation of handedness was made via right and left hand execution. Two mental workload metrics were obtained by electroencephalographic analysis: EEG-cognitive index, and EEG-workload index.RESULTS: The index of difficulty analyses indicated lower movement time when removing the pegs (low index of difficulty) compared to placing the pegs (high index of difficulty). EEG-workload index was higher when placing the pegs than removing. The handedness analyses indicated lower movement time with the right hand compared to the left hand. However, similar levels of mental workload were found.CONCLUSION: Results suggest higher mental effort when index of difficulty is increased, but not when the left non-dominant hand is performing the task.},
